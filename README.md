# Verilog_Processor_Cache
Verilog Project that delves into: Creating a 16-bit unpipelined processor with single cycle memory, then pipelining with perfect memory, aligned memory, stalling memory,  adding a two-way set associative cache, and lastly a fully pipelined 16-bit processor with multi-cycle memory and optimizations
